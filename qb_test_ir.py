Test QuickBot IR sensors.

Run this code on the BeagleBone side.

It will display for about 30 seconds the current values of all five sensors.

While this program runs, try putting an obstacle before each sensor. Unobstructed sensor should read
low value (e.g. 0). Placing palm of your hand at about 2 inches should cause large readings (300-700).

---------------------------------
Modified by hiankun.

The display time had been enlongate to about 300 seconds for longer testing period.

Also, the output had been changed from raw readings to centimeters.

Note that the unit conversion to centimeter was not adquite,
and further tunning is necessary.
